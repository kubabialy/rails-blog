# BLOG

This repository is a walkthrough of https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html.

There are few things that will be added and documented along the way for other people that would like to dig deeper into Rails.

It's a fun project, after doing PHP/JS professionally on a daily basis and some Go/Rust coding on the evening.

Maybe if this project grow I'll use it as my own blogging platform. 

## THINGS TO ADD

- Some more styling
- Proper authentication (maybe, that might change)
- Extend unit tests with a proper explanation what's happening
- Add tags to Articles and possibility to browse articles by tags
- Search by article title in menu
- Menu ?


### DISCLAIMER

It is meant to document learning and perhaps help other learn the framework, some of the comments might be far to obvious for some more experience developers
